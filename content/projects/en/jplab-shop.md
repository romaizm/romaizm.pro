## Project Overview

JPLAB-SHOP sells Asian cosmetics across Russia. The company needed more than just a store — they wanted a full-featured platform with advanced functionality for customer convenience.

## Challenge

Build a modern e-commerce store with extended features: smart search, personal account with wishlist, integration with popular shipping services. Plus — a video review system supporting multiple platforms.

## Solution

Built the store on WordPress + WooCommerce using Breakdance for layout. Wrote custom PHP modules for specific features: live search, video review integration with VKontakte, RuTube and YouTube, smart connection to shipping service APIs.

## Key Features

- Interactive live search — results appear as you type
- Personal account with wishlist and order tracking
- Shipping integration with CDEK and Russian Post with automatic calculation
- Clear catalog structure — easy to find the right product
- Video review system supporting VKontakte, RuTube, and YouTube

## Results

- Customers got a convenient tool for choosing cosmetics
- Automatic shipping calculation reduced workload for managers
- Video reviews build trust and help with product selection
