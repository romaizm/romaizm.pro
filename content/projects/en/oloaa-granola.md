## Project Overview

Oloaa is the leading granola brand in the UAE. But before our work together, their WooCommerce store had been sitting idle for three years: zero traffic, zero sales. Great product, but the website wasn't working for the business.

## Challenge

Migrate the store from WooCommerce to Shopify and turn it into a functioning sales channel. Target — reach 5,000 AED per month. Beyond that, the site needed intuitive catalog navigation and the ability to create custom bundles.

## Solution

Built a completely new Shopify store with a unique design. Migrated the entire catalog and updated all product photography. Implemented comprehensive SEO optimization — from technical foundations to content. Result: the brand now ranks first in search results for relevant queries.

## Key Features

- Full migration from WooCommerce to Shopify with fresh design
- Dramatic speed improvement — Core Web Vitals from ~50 to 90+
- Modern catalog with bundle creation capability
- Comprehensive SEO optimization with measurable results
- Easy management via Shopify admin panel and mobile app

## Results

- Sales grew from zero to 5,000+ AED per month
- Ranking #1 on Google for target keywords in the niche
- Core Web Vitals: from ~50 to 90+ score
- Over 50 loyal repeat customers
- Fast, user-friendly store that finally generates revenue
