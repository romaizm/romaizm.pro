## Project Overview

Custom Garage PC (CGPC) is a company from Vladivostok that builds computers for gamers and professionals. Before the store, they were selling through local classifieds — it was time to level up.

## Challenge

Build an online store from scratch: no brand book, no existing design. Needed to create a visual identity that would set CGPC apart from competitors, plus implement specific features for easy PC selection.

## Solution

Built the store on WordPress + WooCommerce using Breakdance for layout. Designed a unique look that reflects the brand's character — tech-forward yet approachable. Wrote custom PHP modules for specific features: a configuration selector and FPS benchmarks in popular games displayed right on product cards.

## Key Features

- PC configurator — buyers see what's inside each build and can customize components
- FPS benchmarks in popular games shown for each build
- Distinctive design created from scratch
- Intuitive catalog navigation
- Fast checkout with multiple payment and shipping options

## Results

- Top 3 in regional search results
- Transition from classified ads to a full-fledged e-commerce store
- Unique features not available in standard WooCommerce
