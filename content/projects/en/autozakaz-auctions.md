## Project Overview

I built a modern car search system for Autozakaz, connecting to the largest auto auctions in Asia — Japan, Korea, and China. The goal was to give the company's clients a convenient tool for browsing vehicles independently, one that works fast and looks intuitive.

## Challenge

Existing auction solutions on the market lack flexibility, transparency, and reasonable pricing. The client needed a custom-built system from scratch: user-friendly interface, high performance, and room for future growth. All within a tight 3-month deadline.

## Solution

I integrated with auction catalog APIs and built a custom React web application on top of them. The interface was designed to hide all technical complexity — users see only a clear path from search to detailed vehicle inspection. The visual design follows the Autozakaz brand guidelines.

## Key Features

- Custom functionality tailored to the client's specific business needs
- Accurate price calculations accounting for all import nuances
- Fast performance even with massive catalogs
- Clean interface that doesn't overwhelm users
- Fully responsive design for all devices

## Results

- Company clients now have a convenient tool for independent car searches
- Complex auction catalogs transformed into an intuitive, logical interface
- From concept to release in just 3 months
