## Project Overview

Frey Couture is a bridal brand that needed a store to match their product: elegant, visually rich, yet easy to manage.

## Challenge

Build an e-commerce store for a wedding brand with heavy emphasis on visuals — photos of models, brides, and product details. The store also needed to be easy to manage, with custom features for the bridal niche.

## Solution

Built the store on WordPress + WooCommerce using Breakdance for layout. Focused on galleries and high-quality image presentation — critical for the wedding industry. Added custom PHP modules for product-specific features.

## Key Features

- Visually rich design with emphasis on photography
- Fast loading despite heavy image content
- Clear catalog structure
- Brand story and craftsmanship sections
- Convenient online payment options

## Results

- Brand received an elegant store matching their positioning
- Easy catalog and order management
- Visuals that sell — brides can see products in full detail
