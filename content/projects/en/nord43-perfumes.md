## Project Overview

Nord43 is a local fragrance brand from the UAE with production in France. The company had an existing website, but it was outdated, slow, and wasn't generating sales. They needed a complete relaunch — a fast, beautiful, and modern store.

## Challenge

Completely rebuild the online store on the same platform (WordPress + WooCommerce) but with a fresh design and modern technologies under the hood. The main challenge — deliver in just 2 weeks. No time for lengthy design approvals, so the design was created on the fly during development, guided only by the brand book.

## Solution

Kept WordPress and WooCommerce as the foundation — the client was already familiar with these tools. Used Breakdance for rapid development — a visual builder that creates pages without sacrificing load speed.

Built custom PHP modules for products: bundle creation, perfume ingredient display, and other features specific to the product line. Completely redesigned the cart and checkout — replaced the standard WooCommerce checkout with a modern, conversion-focused version.

## Key Features

- Completely new store design with intuitive navigation
- Custom product modules: bundles, fragrance ingredients, special displays
- Redesigned cart and checkout optimized for conversions
- Integrated Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, and Tabby installment payments
- Fast page loading

## Results

- Full site rebuild completed in 2 weeks
- Steady stream of orders every month
- Significant SEO improvement — site now indexes well across search engines
- Enhanced premium brand perception
