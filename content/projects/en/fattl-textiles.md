## Project Overview

FATTL is an emerging fabric brand in the UAE that chose online sales as their primary channel. The company wanted to enter the market with a modern, user-friendly store that reflects the premium quality of their products.

## Challenge

Build a sleek and fast online store that's easy to use for both customers and the owner. Key requirements: support for popular payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe) and the ability to manage the store from a phone or computer without needing a developer.

## Solution

We chose Shopify — a platform well-known to shoppers in the Arab market that gives owners full control through an intuitive admin panel.

First, we designed a unique look in Figma, then brought it to life using the Horizon theme with custom Liquid code. This approach maintained fast loading speeds while delivering a distinctive visual style.

## Key Features

- Custom design crafted specifically for FATTL's brand identity
- Bilingual interface: English and Arabic
- Fast page loading — essential for mobile users in the region
- Easy catalog and order management via the Shopify mobile app

## Results

- From concept to launch in just 1 month
- Complex fabric catalog presented in a clear, shopper-friendly format
- Client manages the store independently from anywhere in the world
