## Project Overview

Avtotseh / TSEH #1 is a company with three business lines: premium car detailing in Vladivostok, passenger vehicle import, and heavy machinery import. All of this needed to live on one website while giving each direction its own space.

## Challenge

Initially, the site was built just for the detailing business. Later, the company expanded and needed to add two more directions — car and machinery import. The key challenge was maintaining clear navigation without confusing visitors.

## Solution

Built a WordPress site with deep customization for three business branches. Each direction got its own section with unique functionality and content. Designed from scratch based on the brand book — a unified style ties all parts together.

## Key Features

- Three separate sections for different business directions
- Custom design based on brand guidelines
- Flexible architecture — easy to add new business lines
- Strong SEO optimization with high organic traffic
- Clear navigation despite complex structure

## Results

- Best detailing center website in Vladivostok
- High traffic and organic visibility
- Three businesses under one roof with intuitive navigation
