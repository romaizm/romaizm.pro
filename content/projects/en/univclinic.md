## Project Overview

University Clinic is a private medical center in Vladivostok. The clinic needed an informational website to showcase their services, doctors, and help patients book appointments.

## Challenge

The main challenge was the timeline. The site had to launch in just 2 weeks. No time for lengthy design mockup development, so we decided to create the design directly during the build process.

## Solution

Chose WordPress with the Divi visual builder — this allowed rapid page assembly with immediate visual feedback. The design was created on the fly, but with medical industry specifics in mind: clean, trustworthy, and accessible for patients of all ages.

## Key Features

- Rapid development without sacrificing quality
- Clear structure for patients — easy to find services or doctors
- Simple content management for clinic administrators
- Fully responsive design for all devices

## Results

- Site built and launched in 2 weeks
- Still running today — over 3 years strong
- One of the top-ranking medical clinic websites in the region
