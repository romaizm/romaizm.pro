## Project Overview

Yuwab is a UAE startup with an ambitious idea: make finding a professional coach as easy as swiping on Tinder. Business coaches, life coaches, family coaches — all in one app.

Users take a quick personality quiz, then browse coach cards: swipe right if interested, left to pass. After a match, they can start chatting and book a session.

I led this project from zero to a finished product, then handed the app over to a major contractor for App Store and Google Play publishing and ongoing support.

## Challenge

The starting point was an idea on paper: "Tinder for finding coaches." From that, I needed to build a complete product.

Key requirements: a single app for iOS and Android (to avoid paying for development twice), a playful and intuitive interface, subscription payments through Apple and Google, built-in chat with coaches, and Zoom integration for video sessions.

## Solution

I chose Flutter — Google's framework that builds apps for both platforms from a single codebase. This saved the client time and budget.

The design was crafted based on the brand book with mobile interface best practices in mind. Under the hood — a proven tech stack: Firebase for database, authentication, and push notifications; RevenueCat for subscription management; Sentry for error tracking; CodeMagic for automated builds. The client's back office runs on Odoo, which automatically receives user and payment data.

## Key Features

- Single app for iOS and Android with identical design
- Bilingual interface: English and Arabic
- Smart quiz that matches users with the right coaches
- Subscriptions via Apple and Google in-app purchases
- In-app chat with coaches
- Video sessions via Zoom with AI-generated meeting summaries

## Results

- From idea to finished product in 9 months
- Client received a modern mobile solution ready for market launch
- App handed off for support and published in app stores
