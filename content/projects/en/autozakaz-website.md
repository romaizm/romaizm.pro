## Project Overview

Autozakaz.ru is the largest seller of cars from Japan, Korea, and China in Russia. Before working with me, the company had a simple, outdated Tilda landing page that didn't match the scale of their business and wasn't delivering results.

## Challenge

Build a full corporate website that reflects market leader status. Requirements: fast loading, strong SEO in a highly competitive niche, user-friendly interface for all age groups. Features needed — informational pages, video testimonials, up-to-date manager contacts. And critically important — DDoS protection, as the old site was regularly under attack.

## Solution

Chose WordPress — the client knows this platform and can expand the site without massive costs. Designed in Figma based on the new brand book, then built on WordPress. Integrated Bitrix24 dynamic forms and set up comprehensive analytics across all site elements to measure effectiveness.

## Key Features

- Core Web Vitals >90 on mobile and desktop
- SEO optimization for the highly competitive auto industry
- Bitrix24 integration — forms, CRM, analytics
- Infrastructure protection against DDoS attacks
- Detailed user behavior analytics across the entire site
- Clean modern design accessible to users of all ages

## Results

- From a simple landing page to a full corporate website befitting a market leader
- Bitrix form conversion increased by 300%
- Site launched in 2 months
- Immediate improvement in Yandex and Google rankings after launch
