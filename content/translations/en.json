This includes custom websites using Next.js and React, eCommerce stores on Shopify and WooCommerce, cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter, and internal business systems. Whether you're launching an online store, business website, or creating a mobile app from scratch — I can help."

        {
          "question": "Do you work with startups or small businesses?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. I enjoy working with startups and small/medium businesses, helping them launch scalable and efficient digital solutions within reasonable budgets. Every project gets the same level of attention regardless of size."

        {
          "question": "Do you work alone?",
          "answer": "In most cases, yes — I handle projects end-to-end. However, I collaborate with trusted professionals on certain projects to speed up development and launch. I also leverage AI-driven development tools extensively, which helps me deliver faster while maintaining high code quality."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is your development process like?",
          "answer": "I follow a clear process: Discovery → Design/Prototype → Development → Testing → Launch → Support. Each stage includes regular communication and feedback loops to ensure we're aligned on goals and expectations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you sign NDAs or contracts?",
          "answer": "Yes, I'm happy to sign NDAs or provide a contract outlining the project scope, deliverables, and payment terms. Protecting your ideas and establishing clear agreements is important for both parties."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you offer ongoing support and maintenance?",
          "answer": "Yes, I offer maintenance plans for updates, backups, security patches, and minor content edits. I can also help you get familiar with your freshly launched website or store by providing tailor-made guides and training sessions."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is a project paid?",
          "answer": "I typically take 50% of the project total upon signing a contract, and 50% after the project is completed and approved. For larger projects, we can discuss milestone-based payments."
        },
        {
          "question": "What do you need to start a project?",
          "answer": "Ideally, a brief outlining your goals, branding assets (if available), and any reference sites or apps you like. Don't worry if you don't have everything ready — I'll guide you through the rest during our discovery phase."
